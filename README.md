Two Toned Scale
===============

# About

*Two Toned Scale* is a scale method for [GIMP](http://www.gimp.org).

It quite simply applies a gaussian blur of factor the same as the scale factor, the result is a smooth scale.

For best results use the *cubic* interpolation method, and don't use when scaling down only by small amounts.

Enter **0** in one of the width/height boxes and it will work out the width/height assuming the aspect is to be maintained.

# Install

You can install Two Toned scale by adding the .scm files in the *scripts* directory into one of your script directories. You can check where these are in the **Folders->Scripts** section of the preferences.
